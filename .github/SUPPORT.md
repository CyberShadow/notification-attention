# Notification Sound Support

To get support with the Notification Sound Firefox extension, please use one of the following channels:

- [Mozilla Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/support-notification-sound/23758/47)

When asking for help, make sure to specify your extension and Firefox versions. An exact description of your problem and possibly a screenshot or screencapture to help illustrate it.

Please note some of the known issues, notably that the extension can't work on all websites. If you're unsure if the extension is working or not, please use the [Notification Tester](https://freaktechnik.github.io/notification-sounds/) website. It lets you easily test if only some aspects of the extension aren't working.
